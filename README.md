This is my personal code library where I compiled almost all the important templates that you will need in Competitive Programming (saying almost just for courtesy). Most of the codes are originally written by me and some of them are collected from others but modified in a cleaner way.

It took me around 4 years to complete the list. Maybe each line is just a line to you but to me it tells a story of the excitements I had while learning those stuffs, the sleepless but fun nights I had to seek knowledge.
