# Competitive Programming Templates

As a dedicated competitive programmer, I've developed a robust collection of essential templates to efficiently tackle a wide range of problems. This repository includes:

- **Segment Tree**
- **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**
- **Dynamic Segment Tree**
- **Number Theory**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Range Queries**
- **String Algorithms**

These templates are designed to streamline problem-solving and enhance coding efficiency in competitive programming. Feel free to explore and contribute!

## Usage

To use these templates, simply include the desired template file in your project and adapt it to fit your specific problem. Each template is designed to be easily customizable and adaptable to various competitive programming challenges.

## Contributing

This repository contains my personal templates designed for efficient coding, and I prefer not to alter these templates. However, if you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to reach out!
